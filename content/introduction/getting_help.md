To get started with Vim, let's discuss how you can get help. Vim has been around for a long time so there are several sources of help.

First of all, Vim ships with great documentation detailing its usage and commands. And best of all, you can quickly access all that information from Vim itself:

To access help you need to be in **Command Mode** (more on modes in the following sections). For now, type the *ESC* key followed by *:* (colon character), then use one of the following keys:

| Key          | Description   																											|
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **h** | Access the basic help |
| **h** *topic* | This will take you to the *topic* section of the help, e.g.: **:h navigation** will take you to the navigation section of the help |
| **h help** | This will provide help on how to use help !! |

Another good resource for getting help is the Vim official website at: [http://www.vim.org/](http://www.vim.org/)
