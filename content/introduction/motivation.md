This project was born out of the excitement and willingness to share knowledge about the Vim text editor by two long time users.

Vim is a fantastic text editor with an unique property: the more you use it, the more you get comfortable with its paradigm, the more productive you become. After a while you don't see yourself using a different text editor. At least that is what happened with us !

However, for beginners, Vim may seem not intuitive so we decided to start this project to share what we have learned and to provide a quick guide to get new users started on using Vim, and perhaps, becoming as excited about it as we are.

Contrary to common beliefs, Vim is not hard to use but it has a different paradigm with modes and commands. Once you get used to that, it will feel more natural. So, if you are willing to give it a try, let's get started !
